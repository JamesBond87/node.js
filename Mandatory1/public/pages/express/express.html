    <p style="color: rgb(224, 218, 236);">Express.js is a Node js web application server framework, which is specifically designed for building single-page, 
        multi-page, and hybrid web applications.
        It has become the standard server framework for node.js. Express is the backend part of something known as the MEAN stack.
        The MEAN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications which has the following components;
        1) MongoDB – The standard NoSQL database
        2) Express.js – The default web applications framework 
        3) Angular.js – The JavaScript MVC framework used for web applications
        4) Node.js – Framework used for scalable server-side and networking applications.
        The Express.js framework makes it very easy to develop an application which can be used to handle multiple types of 
        requests like the GET, PUT, and POST and DELETE requests.</p>
