    <p style="color: rgb(224, 218, 236);">Heroku is known for running apps in dynos – which are really 
        just virtual computers that can be powered up or down based on how big your application is. Think of 
        dynos as malleable building blocks for running your app.
        If you want to process more data or run more complex tasks, you are going to need to add more blocks
        (what is called scaling horizontally) or increase the size of the blocks (what is called scaling vertically). 
        Heroku then charges you a monthly fee based on the number of dynos that you have and the size of each dyno.
        Although Heroku charges you by the dyno, they aren’t actually hosting your app. In fact, the entire Heroku platform, as 
        well as every app built on Heroku is deployed to Amazon Web Services(AWS).</p>
