    <p style="color: rgb(224, 218, 236);">Quasar and Vue.js are frameworks for building client-side applications. By default, Quasar Vue components produce and 
        manipulate DOM in the browser as output. However, it is also possible to render the same components into HTML strings 
        on the server, send them directly to the browser, and finally “hydrate” the static markup into a fully interactive 
        app on the client.
        A server-rendered Quasar app can also be considered isomorphic or universal, in the sense that the majority of your 
        app’s code runs on both the server and the client.</p>
