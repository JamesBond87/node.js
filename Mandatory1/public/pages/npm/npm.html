    <p style="color: rgb(224, 218, 236);">NPM stands for Node Package Manager and is one of the 
        multiple package managers (others include Yarn, Bower, etc.) available for the Javascript programming 
        language. Furthermore, it’s the default package manager for Node.js.
        NPM has a command-line client, which is generally how you install packages. What seems magical is how NPM 
        knows what to download. All you do is give the name of the package you’d like, and NPM knows where to get it from. 
        This is because NPM has an online database of public and paid-for private packages called the NPM registry.</p>
