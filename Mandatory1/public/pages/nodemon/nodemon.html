    <p style="color: rgb(224, 218, 236);">During the Node.js development process, developers are required 
        to make several changes in the running code. To make the updates take effect, the Node.js server needs to 
        be restarted repeatedly. In a production environment, performing such arduous tasks can be a bit overwhelming 
        for the developers.
        However, a possible solution to automate this process and eradicate the need to manually restart the server on 
        each code update is Nodemon. It is a CLI tool made by @rem to automatically restart the application server whenever 
        the code is updated. Serving the purpose under the motto of “reload, automatically,” Nodemon can efficiently ease out 
        the development process.</p>
